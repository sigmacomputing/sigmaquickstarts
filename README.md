## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  1. [Install Node 14](https://nodejs.org/en/download/); Homebrew installed? `brew install node@14`
     - Install gulp-cli `npm i -g gulp-cli`
  2. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install); Homebrew installed? `brew install golang`
     - Install claat `go install github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/claat@latest`
     - Ensure go and claat is in your `PATH` [claat path setup](#claat-related-errors)
  3. **Optional**: install the live-reload plugin for Chrome: [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)

### Run locally

  1. Fork this repository to your personal github account (top right of webpage, `fork` button)
  2. Clone your new fork `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/sigmaquickstarts.git sigmaquickstarts`
  3. Navigate to the site directory `cd sigmaquickstarts/site`
  4. Install node dependencies `npm install`
  5. Run the site `npm run serve`

Congratulations! You now have the Sigma Quickstarts landing page running.

### Common Errors

#### 1. Claat related errors
   - Make sure Go is properly in your `PATH`. Add the following lines to your profile (`~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc`):
````bash
#adding Golang to path
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
````
  ***Note:** After adding Go to your `PATH`, be sure to apply your new profile: `source ~/.profile` or `source ~/.zshrc`*

#### 2. You get a `EACCES` error when installing `gulp-cli`
   - This means that your npm location needs to be updated. Follow the steps here: [Resolve EACCESS permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory)

#### 3. You get `Error: Cannot find module 'postcss'` when running `npm run serve` 
   - The module may not have been installed for some reason so run `npm install --save-dev postcss gulp-postcss` and then rerun `npm run serve` 

## Write Your First Quickstart
**Before you write your first QuickStart, we recommend you:**

1: Watch this video on how to create your first QuickStart:<br> 
[<img src="./site/app/images/styleguidethumbnail.png" width="600">](https://youtu.be/m4DbElos2bI)

2: Review the [QuickStart Style Guide](https://quickstarts.sigmacomputing.com/guide/sigma-style-guide/). We want to try and give the consumer a uniform look and feel for QuickStarts and the Style Guide will give you everything you need to deliver on that.**

**3: Please only use the new Sales Performance Template when creating a QuickStart that needs to make use of pre-built content.<br>**

**Steps:**<br>
  1. Terminate the running server with `ctrl C` and and navigate to the `sigmaguides` source directory `cd sigmaguides/src`
     - In this directory, you will see all existing guides and their markdown files.
  2. Generate a new guide from the guide template `npm run template <GUIDE_NAME>` 
      - Don't use spaces in the name of your guide, instead use underscores.
      - For Standalone QuickStarts just create a simple name that describes it.
      - For Series QuickStarts use the format {SeriesNamn} #: {Name}
          - for example, Fundamentals 2: Working with Tables
          - **NOTE: Then file name is not what appears in the portal; that is defined in the QuickStart itself.**
  3. Navigate to the newly generated guide (`cd sigmaguides/src/<GUIDE_NAME>`) and edit your guide in a tool like vscode.
  4. Run the website again `npm run serve`
  5. As you edit and save changes, your changes will automatically load in the browser.
