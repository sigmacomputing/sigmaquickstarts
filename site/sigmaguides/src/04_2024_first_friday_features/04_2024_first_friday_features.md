# (04-2024) April
<!-- The above name is what appears on the website and is searchable. -->

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart lists all the new and public beta features released, as well as bugs fixed in April 2024.

It is summary in nature, and you should refer to the specific Sigma documentation links provided for more information.

**Public beta features will carry the section text "Beta".**

All other features are considered released (**GA** or generally available).

Sigma actually has feature and bug fix releases weekly, and high-priority bug fixes on demand. We felt it was best to keep these QuickStarts to a summary of the previous month for your convenience.

New first Friday features QuickStarts will be published on the first Friday of each month, and will include information for the previous month.

### Separate export warehouse
If your Sigma organization is connected to Snowflake, you can run all scheduled, direct, and on-demand exports through a separate warehouse. 

This practice isolates export operations to optimize performance and reduce computing costs.

In the `Administration` > `Connection` > `Connection Features` section, locate the `Export Warehouse` field and enter the name of the virtual warehouse created for export queries:

### Interactive chart legends
Interact with chart legend entries to quickly focus on specific data subsets. 

Charts containing legends that represent qualitative segments (like categories or series) support the following interactive filtering capabilities:

 <ul>
      <li><strong> Hover over a legend entry to highlight corresponding data points.</li>
      <li><strong> Click a legend entry label to isolate corresponding data points.</li>
      <li><strong> Select or clear the checkbox of one or more legend entries to show or hide corresponding data points.</li>
      <li><strong> Click anywhere (within the element) outside of the plot area or legend to reset the chart display.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> Changes resulting from chart legend interactions persist when you switch between workbook modes; however, they don’t persist across user sessions and aren’t saved when the workbook is published.
