## Accessing administration
Duration: 20

We will first cover how to access the administrative ("admin") areas of Sigma and then list and describe each of the available options.

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> The admin area of Sigma requires a user to have an account type permission of "Admin". Users who do not have this permission will not be able to any administrative function and the option is not displayed on the interface to them.
</aside>

Admin users can access the admin page one of two ways as shown:

<img src="assets/fa1.png" width="800"/>

We have centralized all the admin options on this one page as shown:

<img src="assets/fa2.png" width="800"/>

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> Sigma provides each client with access to our live technical support team via the ? widget. You can come hear to ask questions in regard to How To/Break Fix. For instance, how do I do a moving average for the last 3 days or why am I getting this error message. They are equipped to handle even the most complex questions from 6am PST - 6PM PST M-F.

Furthermore, you can even schedule a 30min meeting with this team to easily show what you are trying to solve and troubleshoot live on a call.
</aside>

In addition to Live-Chat, there are many other options exposed by clicking on the <img src="assets/helpicon.png" width="30"/> icon:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Help Center:</strong> Explore Sigma's self-service resource library for documentation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Try a tutorial:</strong> Access commonly used features via in-product tutorials.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Sigma QuickStarts:</strong> Step-by-step tutorials for learning Sigma's features and fundamentals.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Sigma community:</strong> Interact with other Sigma users, share knowledge, and get answers.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Keyboard shortcuts:</strong> Learn shortcuts for efficient navigation and actions.</li>

## Account - General Settings
Duration: 20

#### Site
Identifies your user account name, cloud provider, data of creation, URL and when the product license will expire.

#### Custom Home Pages
Sigma Admins can designate a workbook to use as a custom homepage for an organization or team. The first page of the workbook becomes the custom homepage.

A custom homepage functions as a landing page for its viewers..

For example, embedding specific visualizations along with buttons linking to new user QuickStarts:

#### Custom Functions
Admins can define custom functions to represent frequently used complex calculations that combine logic, aggregates, and other type of operations. There are many advantages to adding custom functions to your Sigma practice:

 <ul>
      <li>Use custom functions to encode business logic instead of repeating it. </li>
      <li>Encapsulate complex calculations that are common business use cases, for easier use.</li>
      <li>Expose your proprietary warehouse functions, making them consumable</li>
</ul>
