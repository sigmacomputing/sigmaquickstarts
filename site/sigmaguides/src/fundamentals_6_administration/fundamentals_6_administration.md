## Navigation
Duration: 20

We will first cover how to access the administrative ("admin") areas of Sigma and then list and describe each of the available options.

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> The admin area of Sigma requires a user to have an Account Type Permission of "Admin". Users who do not have this permission will not be able to any Administrative function and the option is not displayed on the interface to them.
