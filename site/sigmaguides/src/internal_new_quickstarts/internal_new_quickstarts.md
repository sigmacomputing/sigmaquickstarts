## HomeBrew
Duration: 20

First we will install HomeBrew, which will provide easier installation of additional packages later. 

Go to the HomeBrew website and click the "clipboard" icon to copy the script: 

[Install HomeBrew](https://brew.sh)

<img src="assets/brew1.png" width="600"/>

In your Mac, open `Spotlight search` and type `terminal`. Then click to select the `Terminal.app` as shown:

<img src="assets/brew2.png" width="600"/>

From the Terminal command prompt, paste the clipboard we copied from HomeBrew:

<img src="assets/brew3.png" width="600"/>

Hit enter:

<img src="assets/brew4.png" width="600"/>

You will be prompted to enter your Mac password:

<img src="assets/brew5.png" width="600"/>

The script will run and you will be prompted to hit "Enter" to proceed:

<img src="assets/brew6.png" width="600"/>

When the script is done, the command prompt will appear as shown:

<img src="assets/brew7.png" width="600"/>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> This script may take a few minutes depending on the speed of your computer.
</aside>

HomeBrew is now installed.

## Node.js (Node)
Duration: 20

We will now install Node.js.

Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance web applications, in this case, QuickStarts.

[Download the Node package for Mac](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

<img src="assets/node1.png" width="600"/>

One the download is complete, open it:

<img src="assets/node2.png" width="600"/>

Step through the installation, taking all the defaults:

<img src="assets/node3.png" width="600"/>

It is ok to delete the downloaded file when done.

Return to our open Terminal and execute the commands, one at a time:
```plaintext
node -v
```

and 
```plaintext
npm -v
```

You should see a version number returned for each command. This means Node and the Node Package Manager are installed and working:

<img src="assets/node5.png" width="600"/>

## Gulp-CLI
Duration: 20

Gulp is a popular task runner for JavaScript. The Gulp CLI (Command Line Interface), also known as gulp-cli, is a separate package that provides the command-line interface for running Gulp tasks.

Using Terminal, run the following command to install Gulp-cli:
``` plaintext
sudo npm i -g gulp-cli
```

You will be prompted for your Mac password:

When done, the Terminal cursor will appear on a blank line.

<img src="assets/gulp1.png" width="600"/>

<!-- END OF NEXT SECTION-->

## Go
Duration: 20

In Terminal, execute the following command:
```plaintext
brew install golang
```

When done, the Terminal cursor will appear on a blank line.

<img src="assets/go1.png" width="600"/>

In Terminal, execute the following command:
```plaintext
touch~/.bash_profile; open ~/.bash_profile
```

This will open your Mac profile configuration file where we can verify that the first two lines (#2) exist.

## VSCode
Duration: 20

[Download and install VSCode for Mac from the Microsoft website.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

<img src="assets/vsc1.png" width="600"/>

When the download completes, open the zip file:

<img src="assets/vsc2.png" width="600"/>

For convenience, we will move the extracted `app` file to `Applications`.

<img src="assets/VSCodetoApps.gif">

Now you can access VSCode from the Mac application view. 

We don't need to open it just yet.

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF NEXT SECTION-->

## GitHub Desktop
Duration: 20

[Download and install GitHub Desktop from the website.](https://desktop.github.com/)

<img src="assets/gd1.png" width="600"/>

In Mac Finder, open the zip file:

<img src="assets/gd2.png" width="600"/>

For convenience, we will move the extracted `app` file to `Applications`.

<img src="assets/gdt.gif">

Now you can access GitDesktop from the Mac application view. Go ahead and do that.

On the "Let's get started!" screen, click as shown to clone a repository:

<img src="assets/gd3.png" width="600"/>

We need to provide GitHub Desktop with the URL of our repository. 

[Using a browser, navigate to the Sigma QuickStarts GitHub page:](https://github.com/Sigmacomputing/sigmaquickstarts)

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> You will need to create a GitHub account (free). If you have not done that, please set one up as it is required as we interact with GitHub later.
</aside>

Click to copy the **HTTPS** URL as shown:

<img src="assets/gd4.png" width="600"/>

Paste the URL in GitHub Desktop under the `URL` tab:

<img src="assets/gd5.png" width="600"/>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> The value for "Local path" is where the QuickStart files will be stored on your Mac
</aside>

Click `Clone`.

The cloning operation will start. This is copying the current QuickStarts content to your Mac. It will take a few minutes.

GitHub Desktop will (when clone is completed) the current repository (#1), the current branch (#2) and give you the option to open this local repository in VSCode:

<img src="assets/gd6.png" width="600"/>

Click to open in VSCode.

<img src="assets/gd7.png" width="800"/>

## Site Overview
Duration: 20

With the QuickStarts project open in VSCode, we can see all the files and folders. We will not be using the vast majority of these when creating content but they are required to make the site work locally. 

<img src="assets/vsc4.png" width="600"/>

Expand the `site` and `sigmaguides/src` folder:

<img src="assets/vsc5.png" width="600"/>

This is the primary folder where content creators will work with QuickStart content.

Before we start working with QuickStarts (first time only), we need to complete the site configuration using Terminal. 

VSCode provides an integrated Terminal to make this easy. 

Using the VSCode menu, click the `Terminal` menu and select `New Terminal`:

<img src="assets/vsc6.png" width="600"/>

A Terminal window appears inside VSCode.

From the Terminal command line, change the directory to site:
```plaintext
cd site
```

Next, execute the command (to install the npm packages inside QuickStarts):
```plaintext
npm install
```

<img src="assets/vsc7.png" width="600"/>

When completed, a command prompt will appear, and information about how many packages were added"

<img src="assets/vsc8.png" width="600"/>

Next execute (in Terminal):
```
npm run serve
```

<img src="assets/vsc9.png" width="600"/>

This compiles the QuickStart web application and makes it available on `http:\\localhost:8000`

There is no "ready" message but if there are no errors, the last line looks like this:

<img src="assets/vsc10.png" width="600"/>

Using a browser, navigate to `http:\\localhost:8000`. The website should load:

<img src="assets/vsc11.png" width="800"/>

## Content Creation
Duration: 20

When creating a new QuickStart, or modifying an existing one, **ALWAYS** create a new branch. 

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> NEVER work in the "master" branch. Your changes will be rejected on publication to GitHub
</aside>

Using GitHub Desktop, click to create a `New Branch`:

<img src="assets/qs1.png" width="600"/>

Give your branch a name and click `Create Branch`:

<img src="assets/qs2.png" width="600"/>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br>  The branch name is only related to Git and not in any way something a QuickStart user will ever know about. It is used to isolate "sections" of work from one another and makes the code more resilient when problems occur.
</aside>

GitHub Desktop automatically switches to your new branch which means you are now using that branch which is isolated from all other branches.

There is also a "Publish" button, which will push the new branch to GitHub but we have not made any code changes so no need to do that now.

<img src="assets/qs3.png" width="600"/>

Go back to VSCode and see that the branch has already been switched here too:

<img src="assets/qs4.png" width="600"/>

We can create a new QuickStart automatically (based on a template) using VSCode Terminal

In VSCode Terminal, we left off with the site running so we need to terminate that. 

Press `CTL + C` to terminate and return to the command prompt.

Execute the following two commands to create a new QuickStart in our new branch:

First change to the src folder
```plaintext
cd sigmaguides\src
```

Then execute this command to create a new QuickStart:
```
npm run template {YOUR QUICKSTART NAME}
```

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> The name you specify will be the name of the folder in the project but not the name that is shown on the QuickStart card later. That is configured in the markdown inside this new folder.
</aside>

<img src="assets/qs5.png" width="800"/>

VSCode notices that changes have been made in the new branch and shows you them on the `Source control` icon of VSCode. 

Clicking on that icon we can see the list of changed items.

As we make ongoing changes to our new branch we can make "local commits". This allows us to revert changes locally at any time. Consider this "local source control". 

When ready to commit (ie: at end of day), enter a commit message and click `Commit`:

<img src="assets/qs6.png" width="600"/>

VSCode provides a "Publish Branch" button but we will use GitHub Desktop for publishing branches to Git as well as creating "Pull Requests". 

A Pull Request notifies the Git Administrator that there is something to review and approve.

Lastly, open the new QuickStart.md file (this is the markdown file that defines a QuickStart).

The template has comments (you can delete them if you want) to assist you in the important items that require consideration.

<img src="assets/qs8.png" width="800"/>

These are the critical items:

 <ul>
      <li><strong>id:</strong> a unique value; use the folder name with no spaces in it is fine</li>
      <li><strong>categories:</strong> The category must exist and the list is provided in the template</li>
      <li><strong>status:</strong> Published or Hidden.</li>
      <li><strong>tags:</strong> must be default unless otherwise specified by QuickStart team</li>
</ul>

Please review the [QuickStart Style Guide](https://quickstarts.sigmacomputing.com/guide/sigma-style-guide/#0). 

This guide provides all the available and supported markdown methods.

## Common Errors
Duration: 5

### 1. Claat related errors
   - Make sure Go is properly in your `PATH`. Add the following lines to your profile (`~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc`):
````bash
#adding Golang to path
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
````
  ***Note:** After adding Go to your `PATH`, be sure to apply your new profile: `source ~/.profile` or `source ~/.zshrc`*

### 2. You get a `EACCES` error when installing `gulp-cli`
   - This means that your npm location needs to be updated. Follow the steps here: [Resolve EACCESS permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory)

### 3. You get `Error: Cannot find module 'postcss'` when running `npm run serve` 
   - The module may not have been installed for some reason so run `npm install --save-dev postcss gulp-postcss` and then rerun `npm run serve`
