# Setup Local Development

## Overview 
Duration: 5 


Snowflake Quickstarts are interactive tutorials and self-serve demos written in markdown syntax. Quickstarts provide a unique step-by-step reading experience and automatically saves tutorial progress for readers. These tutorials are published at quickstarts.snowflake.com

You can submit your own Quickstarts to be published on Snowflake's website by submitting a pull request to this repo. This repository contains all the tools and documentation youâ€™ll need for building, writing, and submitting your own Quickstart!

## Write Your First Quickstart
Duration: 5
**Before you write your first QuickStart, we recommend you:**

1: Review the [QuickStart Style Guide](https://quickstarts.sigmacomputing.com/guide/sigma-style-guide/#0). 

We want to try and give the consumer a uniform look and feel for QuickStarts and the Style Guide will give you everything you need to deliver on that.

2: Please only use the "new Template" method described later when creating a QuickStart.<br>

**Steps:**<br>
  1. Terminate the running server with `ctrl C` and and navigate to the `sigmaguides` source directory `cd sigmaguides/src`
     - In this directory, you will see all existing guides and their markdown files.
  2. Generate a new guide from the guide template `npm run template <GUIDE_NAME>` 
      - Don't use spaces in the name of your guide, instead use underscores.
      - For Standalone QuickStarts just create a simple name that describes it.
      - For Series QuickStarts use the format {SeriesName} #: {Name}
          - for example, Fundamentals 2: Working with Tables<br>
NOTE: The file name is not what appears in the portal; that is defined in the QuickStart itself.

  3. Navigate to the newly generated guide (`cd sigmaguides/src/<GUIDE_NAME>`) and edit your guide in VSCode.
  4. Run the website again `npm run serve`
  5. As you edit and save changes, your changes will automatically load in the browser.
  
To see QuickStarts in your local browser, navigate to:
http://localhost:8000/

## Common Errors
Duration: 5

### 1. Claat related errors
   - Make sure Go is properly in your `PATH`. Add the following lines to your profile (`~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc`):
````bash
#adding Golang to path
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
````
  ***Note:** After adding Go to your `PATH`, be sure to apply your new profile: `source ~/.profile` or `source ~/.zshrc`*

### 2. You get a `EACCES` error when installing `gulp-cli`
   - This means that your npm location needs to be updated. Follow the steps here: [Resolve EACCESS permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory)

### 3. You get `Error: Cannot find module 'postcss'` when running `npm run serve` 
   - The module may not have been installed for some reason so run `npm install --save-dev postcss gulp-postcss` and then rerun `npm run serve`
