# Sync Leads to Hubspot with Hightouch’s Sigma Integration
<!-- The above name is what appears on the website and is searchable. -->

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

Keeping HubSpot contact lists up to date is essential for effective marketing and sales processes and accurate reporting and analytics. High quality data leads to a better experience for both your organization and your contacts.

Traditionally, data teams export contact lists as CSVs and send them to marketing teams, who upload them into tools like HubSpot.The downside is that the data in those CSVs quickly become outdated whenever a new user enters the contact list or if a customer gets removed from the list. With each update, the CSV has to be re-exported by the data team and re-uploaded by the marketing team.

If you're leveraging a BI tool like Sigma to define lists of target users, you can rely on those definitions to sync contact lists to marketing tools like HubSpot or Marketo dynamically using Hightouch.

This playbook walks through using a Sigma workbook and Hightouch to sync a contact list of at-risk customers into Marketo, but you could apply the same general steps for syncing any contact list into any other marketing tool.
