# Sync Leads to Hubspot with Hightouch’s Sigma Integration
<!-- The above name is what appears on the website and is searchable. -->

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

Keeping HubSpot contact lists up to date is essential for effective marketing and sales processes and accurate reporting and analytics. High quality data leads to a better experience for both your organization and your contacts.

Traditionally, data teams export contact lists as CSVs and send them to marketing teams, who upload them into tools like HubSpot.The downside is that the data in those CSVs quickly become outdated whenever a new user enters the contact list or if a customer gets removed from the list. With each update, the CSV has to be re-exported by the data team and re-uploaded by the marketing team. This is time-consuming and error-prone, manual process.

If you're leveraging a BI tool like Sigma to define lists of target users, you can rely on those definitions to sync contact lists to marketing tools like HubSpot or Marketo dynamically using [Hightouch](https://hightouch.com/).

This QuickStart walks through using a Sigma workbook and Hightouch to sync a contact list into HubSpot, but you could apply the same general steps for syncing any contact list into any other marketing tool.

The use-case will be a marketing campaign that targets the most loyal customers in the United States only. We need an easy way to get the data from the Snowflake warehouse over to HubSpot, where we will run the campaign from. We don't have development resources to do this right now so we have to do it ourselves.

### Target Audience

Businesses who need to move data from one place to another while allowing end-users to directly work with the data and make decisions about which data is selected, how it is organized and even provide additional data to enrich it prior to it landing in the target system.

<aside class="postive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> We will assume you have access to (or setup trials) as outlined above before starting this QuickStart. We will not cover the steps to access the base sites as the vendors have made the process very straight-forward.
</aside>

### What You’ll Learn

We will connect to data in our warehouse, use Sigma to orient and enrich it, leverage Highspot to copy it from source to HubSpot where we will see our transformed data land. 
### What You’ll Build

At a high-level, the QuickStart will cover each of these areas:

<!-- END OF OVERVIEW -->

## Snowflake - Get Connected
Duration: 20

We will start by connecting Sigma to Snowflake and use the Snowflake sample database. 

Login into Sigma (as Administrator).

Navigate to `Administration` > `Connections`:

<img src="assets/ht1.png" width="800"/>

Click `Create Connection`

Select type as `Snowflake`, provide a user-friendly name and then the `Connection Credentials` required to log into the Snowflake account. We will use the Snowflake `Role` of `ACCOUNTADMIN` to keep things simple.

<img src="assets/ht2.png" width="800"/>

`Save` the connection and if everything is correct, the connection will be added. 

Before we move on, we also need to enable `write access` so that Sigma can write data back to Snowflake. We will use this to allow Sigma users to add small amounts of data to a table. This table is held seperate from other Snowflake data but can be used to augment existing data. We will discuss this more as we go but for now, let's enable that.

Before we can enable write access, we need to give the user-provided data a place to live in Snowflake and "allow" a Snowflake role to use it. This is straight forward and here are the steps.

Log onto your Snowflake trial account and open a new `Worksheet`:

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> Make sure that your user is set to `ACCOUNTADMIN` as shown by the arrow.
</aside>

<img src="assets/ht12.png" width="800"/>

Copy and paste the following code into the new `Worksheet`:
```plaintext
// Enable Sigma Write Functionality by creating new shema and database and granting permission
use WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH;
CREATE DATABASE SIGMA_WRITEDB;
CREATE SCHEMA SIGMA_QS;
grant usage on database SIGMA_WRITEDB to role ACCOUNTADMIN;
grant usage, create table, create view, create stage on schema SIGMA_QS to role ACCOUNTADMIN;
```

This uses the Snowflake default `Compute_WH` and then creates a schema, database and grants require persmission to the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role. Recall that in the Sigma connection, we are using this role already. 

After pasting the code, use the mouse and select it all and click the arrow to run it. You should see a success message:

<img src="assets/ht13.png" width="800"/>

Return to Sigma, `Administration` > `Connections` and open the Snowflake connection we created earlier. 

Click the `Manage` button and then `Edit`. Scroll down till you see `Write Access`. 

Enable it and provide the values:

<img src="assets/ht11.png" width="800"/>

Before clicking `Save` you are required to reenter your Snowflake password. Do that and then click `Save`. 

If all is correct, the connection will be tested and you return to the `Connections` page.

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF SECTION-->

## Sigma: Source Data
Duration: 20

Now that we have a connection (with write access) to data, we want to filter for the records that the marketing campaign wants to target. We then want to provide marketing a way triage the data further by augmenting the source data with additional information. 

Click `+ Create new` and select `Workbook`:

<img src="assets/ht3.png" width="600"/>

Click to add a new `Table`:

<img src="assets/ht4.png" width="800"/>

Next click `Tables and Datasets`.

Navigate to the Snowflake Trial `connection` that we created and then select the table `Customer` and click the `Select` button:

<img src="assets/ht5.png" width="800"/>

Now is a good time to save our Workbook. Click the `Save As` button in the upper right corner and name it `Source Data for Hightouch`:

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> It is easy to create folders to organize work in Sigma.
</aside>

<img src="assets/ht6.png" width="500"/>

The `Customers` table we are using is large **(65,000,000 Rows – 18 Columns)** and we don't want to use that much data to demonstrate this workflow so let's limit the size with a few filters.

Recall that marketing wants only US customers who are the most loyal.

For the first filter (with Workbook in `Edit`), click on the column `C Preferred Cust Flag` and select `Filter`:

<img src="assets/ht7.png" width="500"/>

Select `Y`. That brings our row count down quite a bit:

<img src="assets/ht8.png" width="500"/>

Now add filters for the columns, `C Birth Country` and `C Customer id`. Your filter configuration should look like this when done:

<img src="assets/ht9.png" width="500"/>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> We are using "Top 10" to reduce the row count for demonstration purposes only. You can use as large a row count as you prefer; Sigma will scale with it.
</aside>

We now have a much smaller dataset for our demonstration (10 rows). 

Before we move on, let's rename the Workbook `Page` to `Source Data` as shown (2x-click the page tab):

<img src="assets/ht20.png" width="500"/>

We will use this data as our source, but we want the user to be able to add values to each row for `Lifecycle Stage` and `Sync to Hubspot` using Sigma. 

We will use a Sigma Input Table for this task.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> Input tables are dynamic workbook elements that support structured data entry. They allow you to integrate new data points into your analysis and augment existing data from Snowflake to facilitate rapid prototyping, advanced modeling, forecasting, what-if analysis, and more—without overwriting source data.
</aside>

[Learn more about Sigma Input Tables here](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/hc/en-us/articles/15802499663507-Intro-to-Input-Tables#h_01GY3EEP9AX8RW2WKVSAAEEZNB)

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF SECTION-->

## Sigma - Input Table

We want the marketing team to triage (and suppliment data) in these rows before we send to HubSpot. Input Tables allows us to do that.

On the `Customer` table click to add a `Child Element` and `Linked Input Table`:

<img src="assets/ht10.png" width="800"/>

We are prompted to select how we want to join the new input table to the source and which additional columns we want to include.

Configure as: shown and click `Create Input Table`:

<img src="assets/ht14.png" width="400"/>

Rename the new Input Table (by 2x-clicking on it's default title) to `Lead Management`. 

It seems a null value has made it through for an email address. We should probably filter for nulls at the source data but for now, let's just filter it here:

<img src="assets/ht22.png" width="800"/>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> If the data selected does not match exactly, that is ok. Sample data can change over time. You can filter data really easily in Sigma.
</aside>

Click to add a `New Column` > `Text`:

<img src="assets/ht16.png" width="800"/>

Rename the column (by 2x-clicking it's name in the header) to `Lifecycle Stage`:

We want users to select from a list of allowed values. This is called **data validation**.

Click the new column and select `Data Validation`:

<img src="assets/ht17.png" width="400"/>

The `Value source` will be `Create manual list` and we want that.

For list values, enter `lead` and hit enter and then add another called `opportunity`. 

Click `Save` when done:

<img src="assets/ht18.png" width="500"/>

Now users can select from the allowed list for each row as they triage the list:

<img src="assets/ht19.png" width="800"/>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> Copy and paste is supported so that rows do not necessarily be completed one at a time.
</aside>

We need another column so the users can indicate if the row is approved to send to HubSopt. 

We do this using the same `Add new column` method, but this time select a `Column Type` as `Logical`. This will let the user select `True` or `False`, with true being approved.

Rename the column to `Sync to HubSpot`.

Lastly, let's move this table to another page and rename the new page, `Lead Approval`:

<img src="assets/ht23.png" width="500"/>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> Seperating source data to a different page makes it easier for the end user to navigate a Workbook and also can prevent them (if configured to do so) from changing that page. 
</aside>

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF SECTION-->

## Sigma - Approve Table

Now that the `Lead Management` table has been approved/rejected, we need to use it to create a table based on only approved leads. This is done using the same methods as before.

Create a `Child table` off the `Lead Management` table. 

<img src="assets/ht24.png" width="500"/>

Change the new tables name to `Approved Leads`.

Set a `Filter` on the `Sync to HubSpot` column and only show `True` rows:

<img src="assets/ht25.png" width="600"/>

We now have the row(s) we want to sync to HubSopt. We are sending one row to make this simple as possible for demonstration only.

<img src="assets/ht26.png" width="800"/>

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF SECTION-->

## Sigma - API Keys

Before we leave Sigma, we need to create a set of keys that will allow HubSpot to access our Sigma content. This is very simple to do.

Navigate to `Administration` > `APIs & Embed Secrets` and click `Create New`:

<img src="assets/ht43.png" width="700"/>

Select `API Token`, give it a friendly name, description and assign an `Owner`. For this demonstration, we need to use our own Sigma account. If we used a different account (ie: a Service Account), we would need to also share the Workbook with that Service Account. 

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> This Workbook is explicitly shared with the Sigma user who created it by default. It is best practice to have a Service Account for integration and security automations. 
</aside>


<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> In production, it is recommended to assign keys to a dedicated service account as opposed to actual people, who may leave the organization at a later time and causing the keys to become invalid.
</aside>

<img src="assets/ht44.png" width="600"/>

Click `Create`.

Copy the `Client Id` and `Secret` values and save them in a text file (or other secure location). We will need to use these later.

<img src="assets/ht45.png" width="500"/>

## Hightouch
Duration: 20

Hightouch is a software platform that allows businesses to synchronize their data between different systems and applications. It helps companies to integrate their customer data, sales data, and other types of information in real-time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or complex coding. 

This allows businesses to make better decisions based on the most up-to-date information available. Hightouch can also help automate workflows and data management processes, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. 

The Hightouch integration with Sigma allows customers to leverage the power of both plaforms together to create high-value 
solutions using moderns, easy to use web-based platforms.

[More information about getting started with Hightouch is here.](https://hightouch.com/docs)

### Define Source Connection

A source is where your organization's business data lives. The Hightouch extension uses Sigma as a modeling method, not a data source. In other words, **Sigma provides the SQL query, not the query results**. 

Before using Sigma to query the data, you must create a source in Hightouch that connects to the **same data warehouse used by Sigma.**

Login to Hightouch. 

If this is the first time using Hightouch, click `Create Workspace` for our project:

<img src="assets/ht27.png" width="500"/>

Give it a name. The `Workspace URL` will check to make sure it is not being used already (as shown by the green checkmark). If all is good, click `Create Workspace`:

<img src="assets/ht28.png" width="500"/>

Now we need to select our source of data. Click  `Select source`:

<img src="assets/ht29.png" width="500"/>

Type `snow` in the textbox and click to select `Snowflake`:

<img src="assets/ht30.png" width="400"/>

We are returned to the `Select your destination` page.

Click the `Select destination` button.

Type `HubSpot` in the textbox ans click to select `HubSpot`:

<img src="assets/ht31.png" width="400"/>

We are now on a page where we can click to configure source/destination details. Click `Connect source`:

<img src="assets/ht32.png" width="800"/>

### Snowflake Source

This is the same configuration data as used earier when configuring Snowflake in Sigma:

<img src="assets/ht33.png" width="500"/>

### Sync Engine

We will use the default, `Standard sync engine` but for very large jobs, the `Lightning sync engine` will provide improved performance. 

### Credentials

Provide your Snowflake credentials. We will use the `Password` method and the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role. Using this role is not recommended in production but makes demonstration easier.

<img src="assets/ht34.png" width="500"/>

Once all is provided, click the `Continue` button on the lower left corner of the page.

Hightouch will validate the connection and if all is good, we can move on to configure the `Connect Destination` step.

<img src="assets/ht35.png" width="500"/>

Click `Continue`, give the source a friendly name and click `Finish`. 

Click `Connect Destination`:

<img src="assets/ht36.png" width="800"/>

Click to select `OAuth` as the authentication method, then click the `Log in to HubSpot` button:

<img src="assets/ht37.png" width="500"/>

We are taking to the HubSpot login page where we can login to the trial account we setup in the prerequisites. 

If you were already logged into HubSpot, you will be prompted to select an account:

Since we are in a trial, we only have one account. Click `Choose account`:

<img src="assets/ht38.png" width="500"/>

Hightouch is requesting permission from you to allow it to connect to this Hubspot account. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click `Connect app`. 

We are returned to the `Connect to HubSpot` page where we need to click `Test connection` before we can move on:

<img src="assets/ht39.png" width="500"/>

If all is well, we should get a success message:

<img src="assets/ht40.png" width="500"/>

Click `Continue`, give the destination a friendly name and click `Finish`.

We are setup with connections now and can click `Configure sync`:

<img src="assets/ht41.png" width="800"/>

`Query your source` we are at the starting point of the integration with Sigma. We need to configure this. Select `Configure Sigma`:

<img src="assets/ht42.png" width="500"/>

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> When we create a Hightouch model backed by a Sigma workbook, Hightouch requests the optimized SQL from Sigma that was generated automatically when we created the "Approved Leads" table in Sigma earlier.
</aside>

Click `Configure extension`. 

Remember those Sigma API keys we created earlier? Locate them (wherever you saved them off to) and copy and paste the values for `Client Id` and `Client Secret` accordingly. 

<img src="assets/ht46.png" width="500"/>

To determine which cloud provider is hosting Sigma, you can navigate to Sigma `Administration` > `Account`:

<img src="assets/ht47.png" width="500"/>

When ready, click `Connect`. The connection will be tested and return success if valid:

<img src="assets/ht48.png" width="500"/>

 If the test fails, you need to confirm and re-enter your credentials.


Once finished, your source appears on the Sources overview page and can be used to set up models.

### Create Data Model

Hightouch models define what data to pull from your source. We'll use the Sigma workbook we defined for the contact list to set up a model in Hightouch.

In Hightouch, go to the Models overview page and click `Add model`:

<img src="assets/ht49.png" width="700"/>

Select by 2x-clicking on the source you've just connected:

<img src="assets/ht50.png" width="700"/>

In `Define model` click on the `Sigma model`:

<img src="assets/ht51.png" width="500"/>

Select the workbook, page, and element that contain our `Approved Leads` and click `Preview Results`:

<img src="assets/ht52.png" width="700"/>

Click `Continue`.

In `Finalize settings for this model`, provide a name. `Primary Key` (from the inbound data) and a folder to store in (optionally):

<img src="assets/ht53.png" width="500"/>

Click `Finish`.

We are now ready to `Add sync` to perform the job as configured.

<img src="assets/ht54.png" width="500"/>

Select our HubSpot destination we set up earlier:

<img src="assets/ht55.png" width="500"/>

In `Configure sync to HubSpot`, select the following:

<img src="assets/ht56.png" width="500"/>

Scroll down and configure the column to match records on and which columns should be included in the sync and to which columns (mapping) in HubSpot:

<img src="assets/ht57.png" width="500"/>

A cool feature is to `Test` before we continue on. Click `Test`. We can select a row (we only have one) to see what Highspot will be sending to HubSpot. This can be useful when troubleshooting sync issues.

<img src="assets/ht58.png" width="500"/>

If all looks good, click the `Close`.

Click `Continue`.

Before continuing, you must preview your model to ensure it's querying the data you're interested in. By default, the preview is limited to the first 100 records. Once validation is complete, click Continue.

Name your model; for example, "Approved leads"

Select a Primary key. A primary key should be a column with unique identifiers. For example, a customer ID or email address can be a primary key.

Click Finish.

In `Finalize settings for this sync`, select `Manual` and click `Finish`. 

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> Hightouch sync schedule options are very flexible to allow many different possibilities including a custom Cron expression.
</aside>

Click `Run sync`:

<img src="assets/ht60.png" width="800"/>

The sync is queued for start and once completed we should get a status of `Healthy`:

<img src="assets/ht61.png" width="800"/>

The last thing we need to do is see the data landed in HubSpot.

<!-- END OF SECTION-->

## HubSpot
Duration: 20

Log into the HubSpot trial account we created and navigate to  `Contacts`.

There we see the one record we added (Sara Huggins) along with the two default rows provided by the HubSpot trial. 

<img src="assets/ht62.png" width="800"/>

There is some refinement we could do to make Sarah's record more complete but hopefully we demonstrated the workflow well enough that it would be easy to take that task on and quickly complete it.

With your contact lists dynamically updating in HubSpot, you can skip the manual labor of updating them every time they change and instead focus on perfecting your campaign.

## What we've covered
Duration: 5

We covered connecting to data in our warehouse, using Sigma to orient and enrich it, leveraged Hightouch to copy it from source to HubSpot where we saw our transformed data land.
