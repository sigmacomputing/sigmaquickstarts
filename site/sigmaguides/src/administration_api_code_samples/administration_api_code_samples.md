# Sigma REST API Code Samples

## Overview 
Duration: 5 
<!--Duration is deprecated and no longer required, however the code still expects to see it so include it for each section. The actual time value does not matter. -->

This QuickStart **QS** provides all the common Markup to be used in new QS. 

Sample code and examples are shown for each item.

We encourage you to review the QS called 

This QuickStart assumes you........

 ### Target Audience
Anyone who is trying to create QS content for Sigma. 

### Prerequisites

<ul>
  <li>A computer with a current browser. It does not matter which browser you want to use.</li>
  <li>Access to your Sigma environment.</li>
  <li>Some familiarity with Sigma is assumed. Not all steps will be shown as the basics are assumed to be understood.</li>
  <li>A development environment of choice. We will demonstrate with Microsoft VSCode and related extensions</li>
</ul>

<aside class="postive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> Sigma recommends that you use non-production resources when doing QuickStarts.

### What You’ll Learn
How to apply Sigma approved Markdown for your QS.

### What You’ll Build

## Environment Setup

### Create Project Folder

Create a new folder on your local computer called `rest_api_recipes`. It does not matter where, as long as you can navigate to it easily.

### Source Code Editor - VSCode 

For this QuickStart, we will demonstrate using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) but you may use any IDE you prefer. 

VSCode, is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

[Install VSCode from Microsoft's download site.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Run the installation with all defaults.

Open VSCode and make sure it loads without error and open the folder `rest_api_recipes` we created earlier:

## Runtime Environment - Node.js
Duration: 20

While developers can use any language to communicate with the Sigma REST API, we will use the popular framework [Node.js. ](https://nodejs.org/en) for our examples.

The [Sigma API Reference Swagger](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/explanation) provides sample code for all the popular programming languages, so definitely check that out:

We need to install Node.js (Node) and configure a local folder with the associated project files, for our project.

Node.js (Node) is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript engine and executes JavaScript plaintext outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.
 
With Node, we are able to set up a local web server that will make a web page available, that we will use to securely embed our Sigma content.
