# Embedding 8: Version Tagging

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart introduces you to Version Tagging in a Sigma embedded environment in order to manage promotions of Workbooks via the 3rd party tools. 

Version tagging allows you to employ a software development cycle to control workbook versions, using tags. For example, Sigma can have a development, staging, and production version of a workbook and migrate changes as needed. This allows you to control which workbook versions are viewable by your users. 

When you create a tag and assign it to a workbook, you essentially **freeze the state of that workbook**. The process of tagging a workbook creates a duplicate that can be shared with other stakeholders and users.  

For example, you can create a Production tag and assign it to a workbook that's used by embed users. Moreover, you can tag additional versions of the same workbook such as Development or Staging. These versions can be used by different stakeholders in your org for review purposes. Once reviewed, you can migrate this copy to Production for your users via external tool of your choice.

<aside class="postive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> One of the benefits of Tagging is your org can modify a Development workbook without affecting the experience of your customers who use the Production version. Once you complete your developmental changes, you can easily update the Production version of the workbook.
</aside>

There are many 3rd party tools available to manage the Continuous Integration / Continuous Development (CI/CD) workflow. 

In this QuickStart, we will demonstration using Github for source control and GitLabs for CI/CD pipelines. 

**Some steps may not be shown in detail as we assume you have taken these other two QuickStarts or are familiar with Sigma workflows.**

 ### Target Audience
 Semi-technical users who will be aiding in the DevOps implementation of Sigma. 

**Sigma strongly advises against using production resources when replicating the exercises in this QuickStart.**

## **Verify Local Environment**
Duration: 20

Before we do anything else, lets make sure the local embed environment is working at a base level. Creating this local environment was covered on the Embedding 1: Prerequisites QuickStart so it is assumed the steps are familiar and we will move quickly in regards to those details.
