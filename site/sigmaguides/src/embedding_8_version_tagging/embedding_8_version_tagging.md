# Embedding 8: Version Tagging

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart introduces you to Version Tagging in a Sigma embedded environment in order to manage promotions of Workbooks via the third party CI/CD tools. Examples of popular Continuous Integration / Continuous Development (CI/CD) tools include GitLabs, Jenkins, Circle CI, Bamboo and many others.

Version tagging allows you to employ a software development lifecycle to control Workbook versions, using tags. For example, Sigma can have a development, staging, and production versions of a workbook and migrate changes as needed. This allows you to control which workbook versions are available to your users. 

When you create a tag and assign it to a workbook, you essentially **freeze the state of that workbook**. The process of tagging a Workbook creates a duplicate that can be shared with other stakeholders and users.  

For example, you can create a "Production" tag and assign it to a Workbook that is used by embed users. Moreover, you can tag additional versions of the same Workbook such as "Development" or "Staging". These versions can be used by different stakeholders in your company for various purposes. Once reviewed, you can migrate this copy to production for your users via external CI/CD tool of your choice.

The tagging design is flexible but at a high level, this is the workflow involved:

<img src="assets/vt1a.png" width="800"/>

<aside class="postive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> One of the benefits of tagging is your company can modify a "Development" Workbook without affecting the experience of your customers who use the "Production" version. Once you complete your developmental changes, you can easily update the "Production" version of the workbook by incrementing the Workbook version number that the tag is using.
</aside> 

In this QuickStart, we will demonstration using Postman to simulate a CI/CD workflow and make manual edits to our local Node.js environment to evaluate the results of our API calls. In this way, we can demonstrate how a customer application using source control and pipelines could be used to make the same workflow work without asking the QuickStart user to create an excess amount of setup to become familiar with the tag workflow in Sigma. 

**Some steps may not be shown in detail as we assume you have completed any prerequisites and are familiar with Sigma workflows.**

 ### Target Audience
 Semi-technical users who will be aiding in the DevOps implementation of Sigma. 

**Sigma strongly advises against using production resources when replicating the exercises in this QuickStart.** 

### Prerequisites

<ul>
  <li>A computer with a current browser. It does not matter which browser you want to use.</li>
  <li>Access to your Sigma environment. A Sigma trial environment is acceptable and preferred.</li>
  <li>A working web server based on Node.js as demonstrated in the QuickStart Embedding 1: Prerequisites.</li>
  <li>A Snowflake account with the proper administrative and security admin access for our use case data.</li>
  <li>Completion of the QuickStart, "Sigma API with Postman" or an API tool that you use instead.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="postive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> Sigma recommends that you do not use production resources when doing QuickStarts.

### What You’ll Learn
How to manage CI/CD operations for a Sigma embedded environment.

### What You’ll Build

We will a sample dataset in Snowflake and use a Sigma Workbook to display that data, based on different tagged versions we will create. We will then display them using Sigma's embedding framework, inside a Parent application.

<!-- END OF OVERVIEW -->

## **Create Sample Snowflake Environment**
Duration: 10

We will need to create three schemas in Snowflake, each having the same tables with names and data adjusted to match the schema name. 

To help you accomplish this, we will provide the Snowflake script required to do this. 

<aside class="negative"><strong>NOTE:</strong><br> The remainder of this QuickStart with reference these tables as our Workbook is promoted from Development to Staging to Prod.</aside>

```plaintext
// 1: CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE AND SET IT TO CURRENT
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE SIGMA_VT;
USE DATABASE SIGMA_VT;

// 2: CREATE SCHEMAS
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS VT_DEV;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS VT_STAGING;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS VT_PROD;

select * from vt_dev.company_country;
select * from vt_staging.company_country;
select * from vt_prod.company_country;

// END
```

<img src="assets/vt3.png" width="800"/>

Once the script runs (with no errors) and we verified the data exists, we can move the next step.

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF SECTION-->

## **Sigma Connections**
Duration: 10

Log into Sigma as an Administrator and head to the `Administration` / `Connections` page.

Click the `Create Connection` button. Select `Snowflake` and fill out the form.

The values for `User`, `Password` and `Role` were defined in our Snowflake Script as:
```
Connection Name:                  User:           Password:       Role:
Version Tagging - Development     vtag_dev        Dev99!          VT_DEV       
Version Tagging - Staging         vtag_staging    Staging99!      VT_STAGING
Version Tagging - Production      vtag_prod       Prod99!         VT_PROD
```

<img src="assets/vt4.png" width="800"/>

Click `Save` and Sigma will validate the connection is good. 

Before we add the other two connections (Staging and Prod), lets take a moment to ensure the Dev data is fully reachable.

In the new connection, click the `Browse Connection` button:

<img src="assets/vt5.png" width="800"/>

Verify that you can see table data for the `Company` and `Company Country` tables.

<img src="assets/vt6.png" width="800"/>

Now repeat the process, adding new Connections for `Staging` and `Prod`. Be sure to use the correct `User` and `Role` for each accordingly.

You should now have three working connections. The only difference is the table data for each.

<img src="assets/vt7.png" width="400"/>

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF SECTION-->

## **Sigma Tags**
Duration: 5


Log into Sigma as an Administrator and head to the `Administration` / `Tags` page.

Click `Create` to add a new tag, 

Set the name to `Development` (pick any color you prefer, it won't matter for our example). 

<img src="assets/vt1.png" width="500"/>

Repeat the process, adding a `Production` tag. You should now have two tags:

<img src="assets/vt2.png" width="400"/>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> To access a tagged workbook, users must be granted access to the workbook or be the workbook's editor. 
</aside>

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF SECTION-->

## Sigma Workbook

Create a new Dataset and select the `Version Tagging - DEVELOPMENT` connection.

Select the `Sigma_VT` / `Company_Country` table.

Click `Get Started`

<img src="assets/vt9.png" width="800"/>

Change the Dataset name to: `Version Tagging`.

Click `Publish` then click `Explore`.

Click the `Save As` button and name the new Workbook `Embedding 8: Version Tagging`

Rename the table to `COMPANY_COUNTRY - DEVELOPMENT CONNECTION`.

and `Publish` the change.

Notice that in the table columns we are seeing `dev` appended in the rows. This is what we would expect given we are using the `Development Connection`.

<img src="assets/vt8.png" width="700"/>

Click the `Version pill` in the header and select `Version history` to open the sidebar.

<img src="assets/vt8a.png" width="700"/>

Click the top entry in `Version history` and note the version number at the end of the URL string. 

<img src="assets/vt8b.png" width="700"/>

When we changed the table title's text value, Sigma recorded that change and when we published it, the version incremented from v1 to v2. We will reference version number 2 in our API call later when we promote to Staging.

Share the Workbook with the `FinanceViewers` team (this team was created in previous embedding QuickStarts) with `Can View` access:

<img src="assets/vt29.png" width="700"/>

Before we get into the promotion workflow, we need to make sure that our parent application with the Sigma embed is working. 

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF SECTION-->

## **Verify Local Node.js Environment**
Duration: 20

If you went though the other embedded QuickStarts, you may have multiple folders for each one. Lets make a copy of the `sigma_application_embed` QuickStart folder and rename it to `sigma_application_embed_tagging`.

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> You can use and of the other QuickStart embedding base folders if you only did a few of them.
</aside>

We will need to edit the `server.js` file for our Workbook so go ahead and do that. We only need to embed the Table.

<img src="assets/vt27.png" width="500"/>

Place replace the `Embed Path` value at a minimum. Your `server.js` may require the to change the `clientID` and `secret` if they are no longer valid.

We will also just use the `Viewer` "Account Type":

<img src="assets/vt28.png" width="800"/>

Bring up a Terminal session against the `sigma_application_embed_tagging` folder and run:

`supervisor server.js`.

Browse to `localhost:3000` to verify you can see a web page with the embed. 

<img src="assets/vt30.png" width="500"/>

We need to make a change to also pass the tag to Sigma (and add it to the URL) at runtime. We do that but adding a section to `server.js` to set the value and then appending that value to the URL that is constructed prior to send.

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> In the string `/tag/Development` the work "Development" should match a Tag that exists in Sigma. We will use this to inform the embed which tagged version to use later. The specific Workbook version number will also be passed in the API call, but is not part of the URL string.
</aside>

<img src="assets/vt34.png" width="800"/>

Here is the code for convenience (leave the lines commented out for now):
```plaintext
// SECTION TAGGING:
	// let tag = '/tag/Development';
	// let tag = '/tag/Staging';
	// let tag = '/tag/Production';
// END SECTION TAGGING
```

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> In the code sample above, we have three statements setting the value for "tag".  Two are commented out. This is so when we test, we can just comment/uncomment the tag we want to use and save the server.js. It saves a few bits of typing and that is always appreciated.
</aside>

and...

```plaintext
// SECTION TAGGING:
  // const URL_WITH_SEARCH_PARAMS = EMBED_PATH + searchParams;
  // const URL_WITH_SEARCH_PARAMS = EMBED_PATH + tag + searchParams;
```

Save `server.js` after making the change and refresh the browser to make sure the page loads after this change.

The page should be showing data from the Development connection.

**Bear in mind that we have not applied a Development tag to this Workbook yet.**

<img src="assets/vt34a.png" width="800"/>

We are ready to move to the next step.

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF SECTION-->

## **Promote to Staging**
Duration: 20

In this section we will use a combination of REST API calls (using Postman) and one edit to `server.js` to simulate a CI/CD workflow promotion to a Staging environment.

<aside class="postive">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> It is assumed that the manual REST calls and json editing steps shown here would be automated with a CI/CD tool and source repository of choice.
</aside>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> Some steps using Postman will not be shown in detail as these were covered in the QuickStart, "Sigma API with Postman". Any REST tool can be used. You may also use the Sigma API Swagger or curl commands if you are more comfortable doing that.
</aside>

<button>[Sigma swagger page](https://docs.sigmacomputing.com/api/v2/#auth)</button>

[It may also be useful to reference Sigma's API reference](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408827709459-Sigma-s-Swagger-Playground)

In order to use the Sigma API, we must first get a new bearer token. Do that, as instructed in the "Sigma API with Postman" QuickStart.

We are ready to have the QA (Staging) team look at the Workbook in the Embed.

We will use the API to tag the Workbook with new values for the Staging tag, version number, Staging connection and Staging path. This will create a new copy of the Workbook (as a tagged version). The original state of the Workbook is also retained if we want to roll back to it later.

<aside class="negative">
<strong>REMINDER:</strong><br> The Workbook in Sigma's UI is currently showing data from the Development connection.
</aside>

First, we need to use the REST API to obtain the required references. We will need to obtain the references (unique identifiers) for:

 <ul>
      <li>workbookUrlId</li>
      <li>Development connection</li>
      <li>Development path</li>
      <li>Staging connection<li>
</ul>

We will use these values to update the Sigma Workbook (in json format) using a REST POST message.

Using a text editor (to hold the json temporarily) update each value that you obtain from the Postman calls. 

**Sample json without the identifiers for workbookId, fromConnectionId and toConnectionId:**
```plaintext
{
    "workbookId": "", 
    "workbookVersion": 2, 
    "tag": "Staging",
    "grantSourceAccess": true,
    "sourceMappingConfig": [
      {
        "fromConnectionId": "",
        "toConnectionId": "",
        "paths": [{ "fromPath": ["SIGMA_VT", "VT_DEV", "COMPANY_COUNTRY"], "toPath": ["SIGMA_VT", "VT_STAGING", "COMPANY_COUNTRY"] }]
      }
    ],
    "sourceVersions": {}
  } 
```

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> Values for paths may be different depending on if you created different schema in Snowflake than what was provided in this QuickStart.
</aside>

In Postman, open the request for `Returns a workbook based on workbookId` in the `workbooks` folder. This will get the list of all workbooks. 

Click `Send` and locate the Workbook named `Embedding 8: Version Tagging` in the return. 

Copy it's workbookUrlId value and update the json sample:

<img src="assets/vt36.png" width="800"/>

We now need to get the GUIDs for the Development and Staging connection using the method `Returns a list of available connections`:

Copy the two GUIDs (one for Development and another for Staging) from the return and update the json code. 

<img src="assets/vt37.png" width="800"/>

Send the API request. The API should return with a 200 Status and three lines of information (number 10)

<img src="assets/vt38.png" width="800"/>

We have now tagged the Workbook to Staging, version 2. We can make this what is displayed in the Parent application embed by changing the one line of code in server.js.

First, verify in Sigma that the published version is showing the Development connection. Refresh the Sigma Workbook in the browser. This result is expected:

<img src="assets/vt39.png" width="800"/>

The red arrow is showing `Version History` and showing that the Workbook has also been tagged `Staging` (#3). This was done by the API call we made.

Now the Parent application will still be using the Development connection until we alter `server.js` to adjust the URL to point to Staging.

<img src="assets/vt39a.png" width="800"/>

Save `server.js` and refresh the Parent application page. 

We now see the table is using the Staging connection's data and the embed URL is point to Stating (on two lines...). **We also see the content creator forgot to change the table's title.** We will have to ask them to update that before pushing to production.

<img src="assets/vt41.png" width="800"/>

Let's try demoting this Workbook back to the Developers connection.

Edit server.js:
```plaintext
// SECTION TAGGING:
	 let tag = '/tag/Development';
	// let tag = '/tag/Staging';
	// let tag = '/tag/Production';
// END SECTION TAGGING
```

Save `server.js` and refresh the Parent application page.

Now we get an error; what happened?

<img src="assets/vt42.png" width="500"/>

In section 5 and 6 we never tagged the initial Workbook `Development`, so any reference to that in the URL was ignored as no tags existed at then. Once we tagged the Workbook `Staging` and later tried to request the Workbook with the Development tag, Sigma could not find that tag associated with the Workbook, so it failed with a `404`, page not found.

We can also confirm this in the Sigma UI by looking at what versions exist as:

<img src="assets/vt43.png" width="800"/>

This is an easy fix and we could have prevented it earlier but wanted to demonstrate it during the promotion workflow as it is a "fine point".

We just need to rerun the `Tags a Workbook` API call, changing the tag to `Development` and flipping the values as shown:

<img src="assets/vt44.png" width="800"/>

Back in Sigma, we can see that there are now Staging and Development versions of the Workbook.

<img src="assets/vt45.png" width="800"/>

Experiment changing the version by selecting between Staging and Development copies of the Workbook. 

When "toggling" between the `Production` versions of Staging and Development you can see the data changes as expected due to the connection configuration associated with the tags assigned to the Workbook.

<img src="assets/vt46.png" width="800"/>

There also an option for `Draft` shown. Selecting this along with a tagged version will take you to the Workbook in edit more for that tag.

In the next section, we will want the developer to make one small change and push to production. To do this, we will have to use the Workbook tagged with the `Development` tag and select the draft to edit it. This will also create a new version (by number) for the tagged Workbook, which we will demonstrate.

![Footer](assets/sigma_footer.png)
<!-- END OF SECTION-->


## Production Version
Duration: 20

We left the Parent application using the Development version of the Workbook. 

Lets assume QA (in Staging) asked us to change the table title and then push right into production. 

Currently, we have a Development and Staging copy of the Workbook at version 2. If we want to see the version number, open `Version history` and click on where the red arrow shows:

Notice that the Workbook changes from "Production" to a specific version and the version number is shown in the URL now:

<img src="assets/vt47.png" width="800"/>

In the "Version menu", click to change to the `Development` version and then `Draft`.

The Workbook is now that copy, version #2 and in edit mode.

<img src="assets/vt48.png" width="800"/>

Change the table title to `Production` and hit `Enter`.

Notice that there is activity in the Version history sidebar? We have a `Pending Draft` with our change but since it is not yet saved, it is not yet a new version.

<img src="assets/vt49.png" width="800"/>

Click on `Publish button`.

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> If you clicked around and got lost, just use the Version menu to set it back to "Development" and "Draft".
</aside>

Clicking the latest Production version in the `Version history` yields the version number in the URL. We now have version 3. Versions 1 & 2 still exist and we will use v3 (with our final table title) for the embed.

<img src="assets/vt50.png" width="800"/>

Tag version 3 as "Production" using the same steps as before.

In Postman, we need to make a few changes to the `Tags a workbook` method so that we are using the correct values as done earlier.

The WorkbookId is the same but we need to change:

 <ul>
      <li><strong>workbookVersion:</strong> 3</li>
      <li><strong>tag</strong> Production</li>
      <li><strong>fromConnectionId</strong> the development connectionId</li>
      <li><strong>toConnectionId</strong> the production connectionId</li>
      <li><strong>fromPath</strong> ["SIGMA_VT", "VT_DEV", "COMPANY_COUNTRY"]</li>
      <li><strong>toPath</strong> ["SIGMA_VT", "VT_PROD", "COMPANY_COUNTRY"]</li>

</ul>

Once you the edits are made, `Send` the request and observe the return of `Status 200` and three lines of information.

<img src="assets/vt52.png" width="800"/>

Update `server.js` to use the Production tag:
```plaintext
// SECTION TAGGING:
	 // let tag = '/tag/Development';
	// let tag = '/tag/Staging';
	 let tag = '/tag/Production';
// END SECTION TAGGING
```

...and save the change.

Refresh the browser and we now see version 2 of the Workbook with Production data and the table title of "Production":

<img src="assets/vt53.png" width="600"/>

## What we've covered
Duration: 5

In this QuickStart we reviewed how to use Sigma Version Tagging to manage a CI/CD workflow (manually) to promote/demote a Sigma Workbook while changing the underlying data displayed to the embed user.
