## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart lists all the new and public beta features released, as well as bugs fixed in June 2024.

It is summary in nature, and you should refer to the specific Sigma documentation links provided for more information.

**Public beta features will carry the section text "Beta".**

All other features are considered released (**GA** or generally available).

Sigma actually has feature and bug fix releases weekly, and high-priority bug fixes on demand. We felt it was best to keep these QuickStarts to a summary of the previous month for your convenience.

New first Friday features QuickStarts will be published on the first Friday of each month, and will include information for the previous month.
