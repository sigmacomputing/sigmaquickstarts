# (01-2024) January

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart lists all the new and public beta features released, as well as bugs fixed in January 2024.

It is summary in nature, and you should refer to the specific Sigma documentation links provided for more information.

**Public beta features will carry the section text "Beta".**

All other features are considered released (**GA** or generally available).

Sigma actually has feature and bug fix releases weekly, and high-priority bug fixes on demand. We felt it was best to keep these QuickStarts to a summary of the previous month for your convenience.

New first Friday features QuickStarts will be published on the first Friday of each month, and will include information for the previous month.

### Column Level Security (CLS)
Column-level security is now generally available.

The feature provides admins with the flexibility to restrict or grant access to column-level data. This granular control over data access allows your organization to secure sensitive or confidential information, ensuring it’s accessible to authorized users only.

For more information, [see Column-level security.](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/column-level-security)
