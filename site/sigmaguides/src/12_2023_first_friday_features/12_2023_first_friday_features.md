# (12-2023) December

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart lists all the new and public beta features released, as well as bugs fixed in December 2023.

It is summary in nature, and you should refer to the specific Sigma documentation links provided for more information.

**Public beta features will carry the section text "Beta".**

All other features are considered released (**GA** or generally available).

Sigma actually has feature and bug fix releases weekly, and high-priority bug fixes on demand. We felt it was best to keep these QuickStarts to a summary of the previous month for your convenience.

New first Friday features QuickStarts will be published on the first Friday of each month, and will include information for the previous month.

## Embedding
Duration: 20

### Bug Fixes:
Sigma now verifies user account type permissions and only sends version tag email requests to users granted the `Create`, `edit`, and `publish` workbooks and `Apply tag` permissions. 

Viewer-licensed users (who cannot edit workbooks or apply tags) no longer receive the requests.

Initial clicks on list control elements in embedded workbooks no longer cause the iframe display to jump to the top of the workbook.

### New postMessage event for element errors:
Elements that fail to load in embedded workbooks now trigger a postMessage event that includes the element ID, message, and API error code.

{
      type: 'workbook:chart:error';
      nodeId: string;
      message: string | undefined;
      code: string;
}

Where nodeId refers to the id of the element that failed to load in the embedded workbook, and the message and error code provide more info as to why. 

The errorCode will be one of the API error codes:<br>
"EEXIST" | "EPERM" | "ENOENT" | "EACCES" | "EINVAL" | "ESTALE" | "ETIMEDOUT" | "EAGAIN" | "EFBIG" | "NETWORK" | "UNKNOWN"

## Workbooks
Duration: 20

### Additional entry point to license upgrade request:
When a Viewer-licensed user clicks `Create New` in the side panel, Sigma notifies them that the ability to create workbooks requires an account upgrade.

The user can send a request to organization admins, who can then upgrade the userâ€™s license by reassigning them to an account type with `Create`, `edit`, and `publish` workbooks permission.
