# How to: Federate Access with Sigma Embedding

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

Sigma's embedded solution is very flexible and can support a wide variety of use cases. For example, 

1: Provide all of your customers with a common dashboard
2: Only some customers a more specialized dashboard
3: Support users at differing levels of functionality (ie: view only versus edit)
4: Combinations of all three or other scenarios

Sigma uses federated user access to support all these use cases and more. 

Federated user access refers to a mechanism that allows users to use a single set of credentials (such as username and password or other authentication methods) to access multiple software systems without requiring separate accounts for each system. 

This is typically achieved through single sign-on (SSO) technologies and trust relationships established between the participating systems.

With Sigma embedding, the user logs onto your application (parent application), is authenticated (and optionally assigned a role), and that information is passed to Sigma when an embed in part of your application. 

It is important to understand that Sigma provides it's own role-based-access-control (RBAC) system and some customers use that exclusively. However, many customers have an existing identity management provider (IDP) and they can leverage that with Sigma instead. Sigma even supports user and group automation using a system for cross-domain identity management (SCIM).

In this QuickStart, we will use the local node.js application framework we created in [QuickStart: Embedding 3: Application Embedding](https://quickstarts.sigmacomputing.com/guide/embedding_3_application_embedding/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0), and Sigma for team and workspace assignments, at runtime.

## Use Case 1: Common Dashboard
Duration: 20

In this use case, we want to embed a Sigma dashboard inside our parent application, and make it accessible to all customers after they are authenticated.

Log in to Sigma and navigate to the `Templates` page.

Click to select the `Plugs Electronics Sales Performance` template:

`Dismiss` the dialogue asking if you want to use your own data.

Click the `Save As` button and name the Workbook `Dynamic iframes`.

`Share` the Workbook with the `Finance Team` we created in the earlier QuickStarts.

Open the `Embedding` controls:

Select `Dashboard` for just the entire workbook and select `Copy`:

In the node project folder, open `server.js` and replace the value for `EMBED PATH` with this new value.

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> If you recently completed the QuickStarts for embedding, you probably already have valid APIs and Embed Secrets. If you don't, you will need to generate them from "Administration > "APIs & Embed Secrets".

Once server.js is setup, make sure that node's express server is running:

Browse to localhost:3000 to verify that we have a working application with our Sigma table on it.

First, lets create a new `Team` and `Workspace` in Sigma.
