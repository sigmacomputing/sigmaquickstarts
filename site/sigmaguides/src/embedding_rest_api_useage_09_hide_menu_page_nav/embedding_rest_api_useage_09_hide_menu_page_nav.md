# REST API Usage 09: Hide Menus & Page Nav

## Overview 
Duration: 5

Some embed customers prefer to have the host application control page navigation and hide the default menu options included in a Sigma embed.

This QuickStart demonstrates how to hide Sigma's built-in menus, and programmatically navigate between workbook pages using the Sigma Embedding API in an embedded application.

<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> Some screens in Sigma may appear slightly different from those shown here. This is because Sigma continuously adds and enhances functionality. Rest assuredâ€”Sigmaâ€™s intuitive interface ensures that any differences wonâ€™t prevent you from completing the QuickStart successfully.

## Start the Server
Duration: 5

Start the Express server in terminal from the `embedding_qs_series_2_api_use_cases` folder and enable debugging:
```code
DEBUG=true npm start
```

The server is ready when it displays: `Server listening at http://localhost:3000`.

Browse to the landing page:
```code
http://localhost:3000
```

Select the `Hide Sigma Menus / Page Nav` page and click `Go`.

Select the `Build` user and the `Embed_API_QuickStart` workbook.

Since we are using the workbook created during the `REST API Usage 01: Getting Started` QuickStart, we will already have two workbook pages. If not, review [section 3](https://quickstarts.sigmacomputing.com/guide/embedding_rest_api_usage_01_getting%20started_started/index.html?index=..%2F..index#2) of getting started to see how the workbook was created.

When the workbook loads, the `Page` menu is set to show all pages and there is a button that allows the Sigma menus to be toggled on/off:

## Hiding Menus
Duration: 5

Clicking the `Hide Sigma Menus` button sends optional user interface parameters to Sigma. These values are embedded in the JWT and can be viewed in the decoded token in the sidebar:

<img src="assets/api_hidemenu_02.png" width="800"/>

The specific parameters we adjusted are:
```code
HIDE_FOLDER_NAVIGATION     # Show folder navigation (default=false)
HIDE_MENU                  # Show main menu bar (default=false)
HIDE_PAGE_CONTROLS         # Show page controls (default=false)
MENU_POSITION              # Position menus at top (When no value is specified, defaults to none.)
```

These default values are set in the `.env` file, and the application updates them dynamically when the button is clicked.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> If you modified any of these ".env" parameter values during other QuickStarts, be sure to reset them to the defaults above to ensure this QuickStart functions as expected.
</aside>

You can see how these parameters are set in your browserâ€™s developer consoleâ€”each button click is logged for easy inspection:

## Page Navigation
Duration: 5

With the Sigma menu hidden, we needed to provide a way to navigate between workbook pages from the host application.

The `Page` list control displays all pages in the selected workbook and allows the user to choose one for display.

The application uses several Sigma Embedding API endpoints to enable dynamic page navigation. These endpoints are fully described in the projectâ€™s `README`.

Once a page is selected from the `Pages` control, the button to hide/show menus is hidden. This is because Sigmaâ€™s built-in menus are not shown when page-level embeds are used.

<img src="assets/api_hidemenu_05.png" width="800"/>

### Page control alternatives
We chose to use a list control for simplicity, but there are many other options available to suit your host applicationâ€™s UX requirements.

The best approach often depends on how many workbook pages exist and how users are expected to navigate them. For example:
For example:

**For just a few pages, a card-based grid can provide visual appeal:**<br>
```html
<div class="page-grid">
  <div class="page-card" data-page-id="123">
    <div class="thumbnail">ðŸ“Š</div>
    <h3>Sales Dashboard</h3>
    <p>Monthly sales performance metrics</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**With 4â€“8 pages, a tabbed interface works well:**<br>
```html
<div class="page-tabs">
  <button class="tab active">Overview</button>
  <button class="tab">Sales</button>
  <button class="tab">Analytics</button>
</div>
```

**For 8â€“20 pages, a sidebar navigation pattern adds clarity:**<br>
```html
<div class="page-sidebar">
  <div class="category">Financial Reports</div>
  <ul class="page-list">
    <li class="page-item">Revenue Dashboard</li>
    <li class="page-item">Cost Analysis</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

**With 20+ pages, a searchable dropdown is typically most scalable:**<br>
```html
<div class="page-selector">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Search pages...">
  <div class="filtered-results">
    <!-- Dynamic results -->
  </div>
</div>
```

Choose the pattern that best balances usability and scale for your users. Each approach can be wired to Sigmaâ€™s page navigation API just like the list control used in this QuickStart.

## Advanced Use Cases
This design pattern can be extended to support more advanced embedding scenarios, including:
- **Role-based menu control** â€“ Customize menu visibility based on user roles or permissions
- **Context-aware navigation** â€“ Display dynamic page lists based on user access or workflow context
- **Branded navigation** â€“ Build custom navigation overlays that wrap and control Sigma embeds
- **Multi-workbook experiences** â€“ Enable seamless navigation across multiple embedded workbooks
- **Mobile-responsive embedding** â€“ Adapt controls and layout for different device screen sizes

Sigmaâ€™s embedding API gives you the flexibility to design tailored, high-quality user experiences that match your applicationâ€™s needs.

## What we've covered
Duration: 5

In this QuickStart, you learned how to customize Sigma embeds by hiding built-in menus and controlling workbook page navigation from a host application. We covered:
- Using .env parameters and JWT settings to control menu visibility in Sigma
- Navigating between workbook pages programmatically using Sigmaâ€™s Embedding API
- Designing host-side UI controls (like dropdowns or tabs) to drive embedded page changes
- Exploring alternative UX patterns for page navigation based on the number of pages
- Considering advanced use cases like role-based UI, multi-workbook navigation, and mobile responsiveness

This approach gives developers full control over the embedded experience while preserving the flexibility of Sigmaâ€™s native features.
