# Azure Private Link
<!-- The above name is what appears on the website and is searchable. -->

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

For Sigma organizations running on Microsoft Azure (Azure), we can securely connect to your data using Azure Private Link. Azure Private Link is a security feature available for Azure accounts. It will allows connections between your Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and other services, without sending traffic over the public internet. In this case, the Secure Link will be created between Sigma and your data warehouse, all inside Azure.

The Azure private link service enables Sigma, which runs in a isolated private virtual network in Azure, to reach customer data via Azure's internal network such that no traffic is transmitted over the public internet. 

Azure Private Link provides enhanced security, reduced network latency, simplified networking, cost-effectiveness, and compliance with regulations.

Sigma currently supports creating private links to three kinds of data warehouse that runs in Azure; Snowflake, Databricks and Postgesql. 

**[Please check here for the latest information on supported connections](NEEDS LINK)**

Standing up a Private Link requires customer's cloud administrator (or similar role) to provide specific configuration detail with Sigma so that the Private Link connection can be established. This is covered in each section later and depends on data warehouse type. 

The process of creating the Private Link can take 2-3 business days once the request is acknowledged by Sigma. 

 ### Target Audience
Administrators who require secure, private connections between Sigma and data in a warehouse.

### Prerequisites

<ul>
  <li>A computer with a current browser. It does not matter which browser you want to use.</li>
  <li>Access to your Sigma environment. A Sigma trial environment is not supported for Private Link.</li>
  <li>Some familiarity with Sigma is assumed. Not all steps will be shown as the basics are assumed to be understood.</li>
  <li>Administrative access to the data warehouse private link connects to.</li>
  <li>A Microsoft Azure account with Administrative access.</li>
</ul>

### What Youâ€™ll Learn
How to establish a secure connection between Sigma and an Azure data warehouse.

## Snowflake
Duration: 20

Azure Private Link provides private connectivity to Snowflake by ensuring that access to Snowflake is through a private IP address. 

Azure Private Link is not a service provided by Snowflake. It is a Microsoft service that Snowflake enables for use with your Snowflake account.

Once provisioned, traffic will only occur from Sigma to the Snowflake using the Microsoft backbone to avoid the public Internet. 

This keeps access rules private while providing secure and private communication.

[You may also want to review Snowflakes Private Link documentation for related details (ie: Blocking Public Access).](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/privatelink-azure)

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> Your Snowflake account must be Business Critical tier to use Private Link.
</aside>

### Provide Snowflake Info to Sigma

Begin by logging into Snowflake as `ACCOUNTADMIN` and clicking the `+` to create a new Worksheet and select `SQL Worksheet`:

<img src="assets/pl1.png" width="800"/>

Copy and paste the following command and run it
```plaintext
select system$get_privatelink_config();
```

<img src="assets/pl2.png" width="800"/>

Below is the output from the SQL query. In the example above, the required output is highlighted: 

<img src="assets/pl3.png" width="800"/>

In the example above, private-pls-id is:
```plaintext
xx123456.east-us-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com
```

and the privatelink_ocsp-url is:
```plaintext
sf-pvlinksvc-azeastus2.abc1defg-aae-4dc6-12qq-g445fb04z112.eastus2.azure.privatelinkservice
```

Copy the values generated for **your** Snowflake account and send these to your Sigma account manager.

Sigma will create a Private Link and alert you when the link is active.

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> The connection in Sigma cannot be created until you are notified by Sigma that the Private Link is ready.
</aside>

Once you receive notification from Sigma (in email) yow can create the new connection in Sigma.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> The notification email from Sigma may include a few extra steps depending on cloud region. Follow the instructions in the email accordingly. If you have any questions about the contents of the email, contact Sigma support. 
</aside>

### Verify the Private Link in Azure

### Configure Snowflake Connection

In Sigma go to `Admin` > `Connections` > `Snowflake`.

Click Create to create a Snowflake connection:

<img src="assets/pl4.png" width="800"/>

In the Account field, enter the three parts of the account URL in this format: 
```plaintext
<account>.<region_id>.privatelink
```

For example, if the account URL is (as provided by Sigma): 
```plaintext
test123.west-us-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com
```

Then the Account field will be:
```plaintext
test123.west-us-2.privatelink 
```

<img src="assets/pl5.png" width="800"/>

<aside class="negative">
<strong>NOTE:</strong><br> The Sigma IP addresses are shown during connection creation should your organization require them.

## **Databricks**
Duration: 20

To support Private Link for Databricks we use a Front-end Private Link, also known as user to workspace. A front-end Private Link connection allows Sigma to connect to the Azure Databricks web application over a VNet interface endpoint.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> Your Databricks workspace must be Premium tier.
