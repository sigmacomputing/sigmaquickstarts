Stipo Josipovic: GA announcement: Drag-to-select and Autofill for Input Tables are now available for :celebrate:everyone!!:celebrate:
Weâ€™ve integrated this classic and beloved spreadsheet feature into Input Tables to make augmenting data for ad hoc analysis that much easier and fun!
With drag-to-select, you can now click and drag to select cells in input tables and level tables!
With autofill in Input Tables, cell selections will now have a fill handle: click and drag the fill handle to extend the selection and fill the new cell values based on the initial selection!
:sparkles: NEW: :sparkles: Horizontal autofill! You can now extend a selection horizontally to fill values in columns to the right of the original selection

Hao Xu: Pasting table values into filter/control is now available
Users can now copy paste cell values from excel/gsheet/sigma table into filters/controls. This solves for a big pain point users currently have where they need to first convert values into CSV and then pasting into filter which can take minutes.

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart lists all the new and public beta features released, as well as bugs fixed in September 2023.

It is summary in nature, and you should refer to the specific Sigma documentation links provided for more information.

**Public beta features will carry the section text "Beta".**

All other features are considered released (**GA** or generally available).

Sigma actually has feature and bug fix releases weekly, and high-priority bug fixes on demand. We felt it was best to keep these QuickStarts to a summary of the previous month for your convenience.

New QuickStarts will be published on the first Friday of each month, and will include information for the previous month.
