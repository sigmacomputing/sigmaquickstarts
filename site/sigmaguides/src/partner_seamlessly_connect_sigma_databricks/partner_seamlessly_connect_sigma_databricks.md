# Unlock the Power of Your Data: Seamlessly Connect Sigma to Databricks via Partner Connect

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

Sigma is a cloud-native analytics platform that provides a familiar front-end user
interface enabling you to query, profile, visualize, and explore massive datasets stored
and shared in leading data platforms like Databricks. Sigma directly connects to Databricks and a proprietary SQL-generation engine that translates user interactions on a familiar spreadsheet interface into machine-optimized SQL. 

Sigma unlocks the power of the [Databricks Lakehouse](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse) Platform by providing speed, scalability and security with the flexibility to pivot billions of rows of data.

 ### Getting Started

This is an entry-level lab that will show you how to create a Sigma account through Databricks’ Partner Connect. This lab is specifically designed for those users who already have a Databricks’ account and would like to create a trial of Sigma to test and understand its functionality.

### Accessing Sigma, Creating a Connection and Assigning Permissions

Starting Work with Sigma

Now that we have your Databricks workspace connected and Sigma trial instance created, the first step is getting oriented in the Sigma UI.

Within your browser, you should see the Sigma home page. In the navigation panel on the left, you will see the newly created Databricks Connection. Click on the connection.

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image4_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

On the resulting page, click one of the two blue "Add Permission" buttons.

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image5_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

Click into the bar that says "Search for members or teams" and a drop down appears. Select "All Members (Team)" so all users of Sigma have write access to this database. Then click the blue "Save" button.

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image6_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

If you expand the `samples` database you will be able to see the sample data preloaded from Databricks.

## Creating a Sigma Workbook
Duration: 20

Create New Workbook

After configuring the permissions and looking at the available sample data from Databricks, we are going to create a workbook. 

Navigate back to the Home page by clicking the crane logo located near the top left corner of the webpage.

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image8_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

Now that we are back at the Home page, we are going to create a new workbook by using the Create New drop-down. Click “Create New” at the near the top left of the page then select “Workbook”.

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image9_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

Once the New Workbook is opened, we will need to select a data source for our new workbook. On the left hand side first select the "Table" option, then select "Tables and Datasets".

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image10_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

On the resulting page select "Connections" then click the “Databricks Connection”. On the next page, select the “Samples” database to show the underlying schemas. 

Now click, the “nyctaxi” schema then finally select the “trips” table. This will create a preview of the data. Next click “Select” in the bottom right corner of the page. 

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image11_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

The trips data is now displayed in a familiar spreadsheet UI, this allows business users to begin to explore the data and do ad hoc analysis.

## Creating a Visualization
Duration: 20

Now that we have our dataset, we are ready to build our first visualization. 

Start the creation of a visualization by selecting the table that we just built, then click the "Create child element" icon on its top right corner and select "Visualization" to start creating a new chart.

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image13_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

This will add a Visualization below our table. On the X-Axis click the plus button to add the "Tpep Dropoff Datetime'' column. Notice you can search here for the column you wish to add.

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image14_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

We can also drag values onto the Axes instead of using the add button. If we look at our columns on the bottom, find the "Fare Amount" column and drag it under the Y-Axis. The value will automatically aggregate and become "Sum of Fare Amount".

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image15_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

This visualization shows the fare totals for each day from the provided dataset. As a data practitioner, you may want to look at this in a different context. This can be done by changing the X and Y-axis.

For the X-axis, let’s truncate the value by Week. This is performed by clicking on the drop-down to the right of the “Tpep Dropoff Datetime” then selecting “Truncate date” and finally selecting “Week”.

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image16_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

For the Y-axis, let's update the aggregation to “Avg of Fare Amount”. This is performed by clicking on the drop-down to the right of the “Sum of Fare Amount” then selecting “Set Aggregate” and finally selecting “Avg”.

<img src="assets/Databricks_PartnerConnect_Image17_upd.jpg" width="800"/>

Thus creating a visualization showing the Average Fare by Week for the given dataset. This creates a very powerful ad-hoc analysis, where a business user can now understand how the average fare is trending weekly during this time period.
