# Implementing Row Level Security
<!-- The above name is what appears on the website and is searchable. -->

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart provides insight into the different methods available for content creators to limit data access to user based on an implementation of row level security (RLS) in Sigma. 

While there are several options that we will explore, RLS should **always** be applied as close to the data as possible. In the case of Sigma, that is at the dataset being used to drive workbooks. 

There are four methods to apply RLS at the dataset level:

**1:** CurrentUserEmail()

**2:** CurrentUserTeam()

**3:** User Attibutes

**4:** Custom SQL

It is also possible to apply data security at the warehouse level, but that is not in the scope of this QuickStart.

 ### Target Audience
Anyone who is trying to enforce row level security, such that the logged in Sigma user only has access to data they are allowed to see.

### Prerequisites

<ul>
  <li>A computer with a current browser. It does not matter which browser you want to use.</li>
  <li>Access to your Sigma environment.</li>
  <li>Some familiarity with Sigma is assumed. Not all steps will be shown as the basics are assumed to be understood.</li>
</ul>
