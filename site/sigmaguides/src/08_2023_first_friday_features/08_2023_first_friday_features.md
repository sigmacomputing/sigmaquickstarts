# (08-2023) August Highlights

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart lists all the new and public beta features released, as well as bugs fixed in August 2023.

It is summary in nature, and you should refer to the specific Sigma documentation links provided for more information.

**Public beta features will carry the section text "BETA".**

All other features are considered released (GA or generally available).

Sigma actually has feature and bug fix releases weekly, and high-priority bug fixes on demand. We felt it was best to keep these QuickStarts to a summary of the previous month for your convenience.

New QuickStarts will be published on the first Friday of each month, and will include information for the previous month.

## Custom Functions
Duration: 20
Use custom functions in your Sigma practice to encode business logic instead of repeating it, encapsulate complex calculations that are common business use cases for easier use, and to expose your proprietary warehouse functions and make them more consumable. See Custom functions.

## Input tables (Now with AI!)
Duration: 20

Input tables now support AI-generated columns. Use structured AI prompts to perform data classification, sentiment analysis (opinion mining), and column fill (data synthesis).

AI-enhanced input tables utilize the OpenAI integration, which allows Sigma to leverage OpenAI language models (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models that power ChatGPT).
For more information, see Create AI-enhanced input tables.

### Default blue in custom themes
Sigma now features a new default blue (#0059EB) across the product.

To preserve the appearance of existing workbooks, **the color change has not been applied to custom workbook themes** that utilized the previous default blue as the primary color. 

You must manually update custom workbook themes to change the primary color to the new default blue.
