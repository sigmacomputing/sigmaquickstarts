This content has been imported from another markdown file. An imported document is called a fragment. Fragments are great when you have common information across multiple sigmaguides. 


While you can embed things like images, videos, and surveys inside a fragment; you cannot define additional, top-level steps inside a fragment. 

### Videos
<video id="dQw4w9WgXcQ"></video>

### Inline Surveys
<form>
  <name>What is your favorite color?</name>
  <input type="radio" value="Blue">
  <input type="radio" value="Green">
</form>
