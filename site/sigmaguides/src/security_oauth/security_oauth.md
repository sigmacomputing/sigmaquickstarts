# Open Authorization (OAuth)

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart **QS** provides all the common Markup to be used in new QS. 

Sample code and examples are shown for each item.

We encourage you to review the QS called 

This QuickStart assumes you........

 ### Target Audience

Sigma administrators interested in implementing RSA connection encryption via key pair authorization and key rotation.

### Prerequisites

<ul>
  <li>A computer with a current browser. It does not matter which browser you want to use.</li>
  <li>Access to a Sigma environment.</li>
  <li>Access to a Snowflake environment. Enterprise is required for trial account testing</li>
  <li>Some familiarity with Sigma is assumed. Not all steps will be shown as the basics are assumed to be understood.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="postive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> Sigma recommends that you use non-production resources when doing QuickStarts.

## What is OAuth?
Duration: 20

OAuth, which stands for Open Authorization, is an open standard developed by the [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://www.ietf.org/) for access delegation. 

It provides a secure way for applications to access user information without requiring the user to expose their passwords.

As the time of this QuickStart, the most widely used version of OAuth is 2.0, which is based on [IEFT RFC6749.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service. 

This can be done either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

OAuth allows third-party services (ie: Sigma) to exchange tokens (with Snowflake for example) for authentication, enabling secure and streamlined access to user resources.

### Why Use OAuth?

#### Enhanced Security:
OAuth significantly improves security by allowing users to grant access to their data without sharing their passwords. This minimizes the risk of credentials being exposed or stolen.

#### Granular Access Control:
With OAuth, users can control the level of access granted to third-party applications. This means they can specify which resources or data the application can access and for how long.

#### Seamless User Experience:
OAuth allows users to authorize applications quickly and easily, providing a smooth and hassle-free authentication process. This improves user experience by reducing the need for repeated logins and password entries.

#### Interoperability:
OAuth is widely adopted and supported by many major platforms and services, making it a versatile solution for authentication and authorization across different systems and applications.

It is widely used as a way to grant websites or applications limited access to a user's information without exposing their passwords. OAuth allows third-party services to exchange tokens for authentication, enabling secure and streamlined access to user resources.

### Benefits of Using OAuth with Sigma

#### Secure Data Access:
By using OAuth, Sigma users can securely connect to Snowflake, ensuring that their data access is controlled and monitored.

#### Simplified Integration:
OAuth simplifies the integration process between Sigma and Snowflake, reducing the complexity of managing credentials and access permissions.

#### Improved Compliance:
OAuth helps organizations comply with security and privacy regulations by providing robust access control mechanisms and minimizing the exposure of sensitive credentials.

By using OAuth, you enhance the security, control, and user experience of your data access processes, ensuring a seamless and secure interaction between Sigma and the cloud data warehouse.
