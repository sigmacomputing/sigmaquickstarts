## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart lists all the new and public beta features released, as well as bugs fixed in July 2025.

It is summary in nature, and you should refer to the specific Sigma documentation links provided for more information.

### Subscribe to What's New in Sigma
For those wanting to see what Sigma is doing on each week, release notes are now also available on the [Sigma Community site](https://community.sigmacomputing.com/). There, you can **opt in to receive notifications about future release notes** in order to stay on top of everything new happening at Sigma. You can also subscribe to automated updates in any Slack channel using the Sigma Community release notes RSS feed. 

For more information on how to subscribe to release note notifications, see [About the release notes](https://community.sigmacomputing.com/t/about-the-release-notes-category/5517) 

**Public beta features will carry the section text "Beta".**

All other features are considered released (**GA** or generally available).

Sigma actually has feature and bug fix releases weekly, and high-priority bug fixes on demand. We felt it was best to keep these QuickStarts to a summary of the previous month for your convenience.

New first Friday features QuickStarts will be published on the first Friday of each month, and will include information for the previous month.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> Some screens in Sigma may appear slightly different from those shown in QuickStarts. This is because Sigma continuously adds and enhances functionality. Rest assured, Sigmaâ€™s intuitive interface ensures that any differences will not prevent you from successfully completing any QuickStart.

<!-- END OF SECTION-->


## Workbooks
Duration: 20

### Deprecation: {{ }} format
Previously, control values could be referenced in image and embed elements using the format `{{control-id}}`. This format has been deprecated, and existing elements using this format have been migrated to use dynamic text. 

Press `=` on your keyboard to open the formula bar and reference control values via dynamic text.

### Copy/Paste improvement
Pasted elements previously appeared at the default size for that element. Now, pasted elements match the size of the copied element.

### Custom banding colors for table and pivot table rows
When formatting a table or pivot table, you can now use custom colors for row banding.

For more information, see [Banding](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/format-and-customize-a-table#banding)

### Double-click to rename tabs in tabbed containers
You can now double-click the name of a tab in a tabbed container to rename it. This is in addition to the previously available rename options in the editor panel.

### Excel-formatted exports include empty cell display value
If your pivot table has an empty cell display value set, scheduled and on demand exports to Excel (XLSX) of that pivot table now include the display value.

### Export to cloud storage (GA) <img src="assets/heart_icon.png" width="25"/>
If your workbook has elements from a Snowflake or Redshift connection, exporting the data for those elements to cloud storage associated with those connections is now generally available.

### Export to Microsoft Teams and SharePoint (GA) <img src="assets/heart_icon.png" width="25"/>
You can now export a workbook, workbook page, or element from Sigma to a Microsoft Teams channel or a Microsoft SharePoint folder.

To start exporting to Teams or SharePoint, a user assigned the Admin account type must set up a [Microsoft integration](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/manage-microsoft-integration)and the relevant account type permission must be enabled for users.

For more information, see [Export to Microsoft Teams](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/export-to-microsoft-teams) or [Export to Microsoft SharePoint](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/export-to-microsoft-sharepoint)

### Export PDFs to larger page sizes (GA)
When you export a workbook, page, or element to a PDF, you can now choose the page size. In addition to the previously supported Letter size, you can now export to Legal, Tabloid, A0, A1, A2, A3, and A4 page sizes.

### Improved details in data source selection <img src="assets/heart_icon.png" width="25"/>
When browsing for a data source in Sigma, such as when choosing or changing the source for a data element, you can see the connection name, full path to the table, and any usage statistics for the table. For example:

<img src="assets/fff_07_2025_02.png" width="400"/>

### Number input control operators
You can now configure a `number input` control to filter the targeted data differently. Other filter operators besides the default of `=` (equal to) to show data that is `greater than or equal to (>=)` or `less than or equal to (<=)` the inputted number value. The new functionality is shown below:

<img src="assets/fff_07_2025_03.png" width="600"/>

For more information, see [Intro to control elements](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/intro-to-control-elements)

### Optional version tag descriptions
When you create a version tag you are no longer required to enter a description for it.

### Pivot table totals changes
The placement of pivot table totals has changed to be up one level in the table. For row totals, the change is only visible when displaying rows as separate columns. This change will be available gradually over the next week.

<img src="assets/fff_07_2025_12.png" width="800"/>

### Reference data elements in custom SQL statements (GA)
You can reference data elements and other custom SQL elements in SQL statements in Sigma using the `sigma_element` syntax. Creating a warehouse view from a table created using custom SQL that uses this syntax is also now supported.

For more information, see [Write custom SQL](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/write-custom-sql)

### Tabbed containers (GA) <img src="assets/heart_icon.png" width="25"/>
Sigma now supports tabbed container elements. 

Add a tabbed container to your workbook pages when you want to offer multiple sets of content in the same section of your workbook canvas. A tabbed container has multiple tabs at the top of the container, which can either be visible or hidden for end users. 

By placing content on different tabs and configuring logic about which tab should display, you can allow users to experience different views in the same space without scrolling or navigating elsewhere. 

<img src="assets/tabbed-containers.gif">

For more information, see [Use tabbed containers to organize workbook content](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/use-tabbed-containers-to-organize-workbook-content)

### View column descriptions in pivot tables
If your pivot table contains columns with descriptions set, you can now hover over the column header to view the column description.

### Warehouse view support for transposed tables
You can now create a warehouse view for a transposed table.

To transpose a table, see [Transpose a table](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/transpose-a-table) 

To create a warehouse view, see [Create and manage warehouse views](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/create-and-manage-workbook-warehouse-views)

### Workbook descriptions <img src="assets/heart_icon.png" width="25"/>
You can now add descriptions to a workbook. Describe what the workbook is for, how it can be used, and other useful information. Workbook descriptions can be viewed by anyone with access to view the workbook.

**To add a description:**<br>
- Select the workbook name to open the document menu, then select `About this workbook.`
- In the text box below the workbook name, type a description. The description saves automatically.
