# (07-2023) July Highlights

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart lists all the new and public beta features released, as well as bugs fixed in July 2023. 

It is summary in nature and you should refer to the specific [Sigma documentation](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/hc/en-us) links provided for more information.

**Public beta features will carry the section text "BETA".** 

All other features are considered released (GA or generally available).
 
Sigma actually has feature and bug fix releases weekly, and high-priority bug fixes on demand. We felt is was best to keep these QuickStarts to a summary of the previous month for your convenance.

New QuickStarts will be published on the first Friday of each month, and will include information for the previous month.

## Admin Features

### Warehouse Views
Workbook warehouse views are now generally available (beta version launched April 2023). 

Warehouse views are **virtual tables in Snowflake** that you can query using Sigma or any other application in your data ecosystem. 

Instead of storing data in a Snowflake database table, a view saves a SQL statement that expresses specific query logic defined by the data element or input table in Sigma.

Warehouse views can be very useful, depending on the use case:

 <li>
    <ol type="n"> 
      <li><strong>Simplification:</strong> They can simplify complex queries. You can create a view that presents a subset of your data or pre-aggregates data, so users can run simpler queries.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> You can use views to restrict the data that users can access. For example, you can create a view that excludes sensitive data and gives users access to the view instead of the base tables.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> If you have a complex calculation that is used in many queries, you can include that calculation in a view to ensure it's consistently applied.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance:</strong> In some cases, views can improve performance. For example, if you regularly run a complex, resource-intensive query, you would materialize that data and use a warehouse view to fetch the results of the query, reducing the computational load for subsequent runs.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<aside class="positive">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br> When you create a warehouse view, you establish a live link between Snowflake and Sigma. The view references the data element or input table as the source of truth and automatically updates to reflect the most recent version of the elementâ€™s underlying data.

The warehouse view is created and you are able to check the status [See Warehouse view status](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/hc/en-us/articles/15802549297171#h_01GZPSFH3VD38P9ZF6EMZHMXTP):

## API

### Members
You can now use the ***PATCH /v2/members/{memberId}*** endpoint to reassign documents when you archive a member. In the request body, set ***isArchived*** to ***true*** and set ***newOwnerId*** to the member who will receive the docs from the archived member.

### Workbooks
When you create a new workbook using ***POST /v2/workbooks*** endpoint, you can assign an owner by passing ***ownerId*** in the request body. If you don't include this, the owner is the user whose token was used to call the API.

A new query parameter is also available for  this endpoint, ***versionTagId***.

### Connections
The /v2/connections endpoint now returns the following Connection metadata fields:

{
  "account": "string",
  "warehouse": "string",
  "user": "string",
  "role": "string",
  "timeout": {
    "default": 0,
    "worksheet": 0,
    "dashboard": 0,
    "download": 0
  },
  "poolSizes": {
    "adhocPoolSize": 0,
    "catalogPoolSize": 0,
    "resultPoolSize": 0,
    "schedulePoolSize": 0
  },
  "writeAccess": boolean,
  "friendlyName": boolean,
  "writeDatabase": "string",
  "writeSchema": "string",
  "materializationWarehouse": "string"
}

## Embedding 
Duration: 20

### Convert Embed Users to Standard
Admins can now convert Embed users to Standard, or vice versa. If you convert an Embed user to Standard, you must define their Account Type. 

### Embed Parameters
The following optional user-backed embed parameters are now available:

 <ul>
      <li><strong>show_workbook_name:</strong> A boolean value that displays the workbook name near the folder icon.</li>
      <li><strong>menu_position:</strong> Allows you to change the position of the toolbar to top, bottom, or none.</li>
</ul>

## Templates
Duration: 20

### Share Templates with different orgs
You can share Sigma templates with other organizations.  This functionality is useful for customers who control multiple Sigma orgs and to create new Sigma orgs for their customers, allowing you to share templates with your customers.
When you share a template, no actual data is shared with the recipient organization.

### Templates tab
The Templates tab is now split between External and Internal. 

 <ul>
      <li><strong>Internal:</strong> Templates created by members of your organization.</li>
      <li><strong>External:</strong> Templates shared with your organization.</li>
</ul>

## Visualizations
Duration: 20

### Chart color scales
When you apply color scales to charts (in the `Element properties` > `Marks` > `Color tab`), the color menu now displays all options in various sequential and diverging color scale categories. The menu also offers new color scales, including color-blind accessible options.

The full palette:

### Double-click chart legend values
Chart legends now support double-click actions. Prior to this update, Sigma interpreted a rapid double-click as two separate inputs that would select the value on the first click and deselect it on the second. Sigma now interprets a rapid double-click as a single input.
