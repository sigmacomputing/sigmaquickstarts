# Working with Metrics
<!-- The above name is what appears on the website and is searchable. -->

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart **QS** discusses and demonstrates how to use Sigma Metrics. 

Metrics in bi (business intelligence) refer to the quantitative measurements used to evaluate and analyze the performance of a business. These metrics are used to assess various aspects of a business, including financial performance, customer behavior, operational efficiency, and more.

Common metrics used in business intelligence include:

    Revenue: This metric tracks the total income generated by a business over a period of time.

    Customer retention: This metric measures the percentage of customers who continue to use a business's products or services over time.

    Net Promoter Score (NPS): This metric gauges customer satisfaction and loyalty by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a business to others.

    Conversion rate: This metric measures the percentage of website visitors who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase or filling out a form.

    Cost per acquisition (CPA): This metric calculates the cost of acquiring a new customer.

    Return on Investment (ROI): This metric calculates the financial return on a particular investment, such as a marketing campaign or product development initiative.

By tracking and analyzing these metrics, businesses can gain valuable insights into their performance and make data-driven decisions to improve their operations, better serve their customers, and increase their profitability.

Metrics in Sigma provide a way to ensure consistent metric logic across tables, visualizations, and pivot tables.
