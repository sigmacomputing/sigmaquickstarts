# Parsing JSON Data with Ease
<!-- The above name is what appears on the website and is searchable. -->

## Overview 
Duration: 5 

This QuickStart **QS** provides all the common Markup to be used in new QS. 

JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, has become a universally accepted standard for data interchange on the web due to its simplicity, readability, and language-independent nature. Parsing JSON data refers to the process of taking a piece of data (typically a string) in JSON format and converting it into a format that your programming language can understand and manipulate, such as an object, array, or other data types. This allows programs to extract values, iterate through arrays, and read key-value pairs from objects. Whether you're receiving data from a web API, reading from a file, or working with local data, knowing how to parse JSON is crucial in modern software development, as it enables data exchange and the structuring of data in a consistent, easy-to-understand format.
